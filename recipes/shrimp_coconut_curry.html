1.5–2 lb shrimp, peeled/deveined (tails off)

1 tbsp neutral oil or coconut oil

1 medium onion, thinly sliced

3–4 cloves garlic, minced

1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated (or 1 tsp ground ginger)

2–3 tbsp mild curry powder (choose one without “hot”/chili)

1 tsp ground turmeric (optional, but nice)

1 (13.5 oz) can full-fat coconut milk

1 cup chicken stock (or water)

1–2 tbsp tomato paste (optional, adds body; still tastes “coconut curry”)

1 tbsp fish sauce (optional but great; skip if you don’t have it)

1–1.5 tsp salt (start with 1 tsp), black pepper

2–3 cups veg: green beans, bell pepper, zucchini, spinach, or peas
(For meal prep I like green beans + spinach.)

Finish: 1–2 limes (juice + zest optional), chopped cilantro (optional)


Method

Aromatics
Heat oil over medium. Add onion + a pinch of salt. Cook until soft and lightly golden.
Add garlic and ginger; cook ~30 seconds until fragrant.

Spices
Add curry powder and turmeric. Stir in the oil for 30–60 seconds to bloom.

Base
Stir in tomato paste (if using) and cook until slightly darkened.
Add coconut milk + stock, stir smooth.

Simmer
Bring to a gentle simmer. Add fish sauce, salt, and black pepper.
Simmer 8–10 minutes to let it come together.

Veg
Add sturdier veg (green beans, bell pepper, zucchini) first; simmer a few minutes.
Add quick veg (spinach, peas) at the end.

Shrimp
Add shrimp and cook just until pink and opaque, ~2–3 minutes.

Finish
Lime juice to taste (zest if you want brightness). Adjust salt/fish sauce.
